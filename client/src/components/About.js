        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Born from the simple idea that one person's discard could be another's treasure, 'Curble' was created to facilitate these exchanges with ease and safety. What started as a small initiative has grown into a vibrant community of sharers in NYC, environmental advocates, and individuals passionate about making a difference, one curb at a time.</p>

        <img src={nycCouchImage} alt="Couch in NYC" data-aos="zoom-in"/>
        <p>At 'Curble', we believe in the power of community and the significant impact of sharing. Our platform is more than just a marketplace; it's a movement towards sustainability, reducing waste, and strengthening neighborhood bonds.</p>
        <p>By connecting individuals to give and get items for free, we're not only decluttering homes but also ensuring that usable goods find new life elsewhere, rather than in landfills.</p>
